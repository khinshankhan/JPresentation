## Backjround and jeneral info

J was created in early 1990s.
J is considered to be extremely terse and difficult to use by most programmers.

- a notational programming language designed for interactive use
- an array language; data is universally structured as rectangular arrays 
- a functional language: creation and composition of functions is emphasized 
- object-module and imperative techniques are supported, but not required

 There will some code later to show why it’s so hard to transition into using. 

## Where did it come from? 

It is a synthesis of APL and the FP and FL function-level languages created by John Backus. While project leader with IBM Backus developed in the early 1950's with his team Fortran -- Formula Translator, the first widely used high-level programming language. He also created BNF (Backus Normal Form or Backus–Naur Form), a metalanguage used to describe other languages. 

- APL: A Programming Language. 1964. Main datatype is multidimensional Array, influenced many languages
- FP: Functional Programming. 1977  The de facto standard for functional programming. 
- FL: Functional Level. Successor of FP
