## Backjround and jeneral info

J was created in early 1990s.
J is considered to be extremely terse and difficult to use by most programmers.

- a notational programming language designed for interactive use
- an array language; data is universally structured as rectangular arrays 
- a functional language: creation and composition of functions is emphasized 
- object-module and imperative techniques are supported, but not required

 There will some code later to show why it’s so hard to transition into using. 

## Where did it come from? 

It is a synthesis of APL and the FP and FL function-level languages created by John Backus. While project leader with IBM Backus developed in the early 1950's with his team Fortran -- Formula Translator, the first widely used high-level programming language. He also created BNF (Backus Normal Form or Backus–Naur Form), a metalanguage used to describe other languages. 

- APL: A Programming Language. 1964. Main datatype is multidimensional Array, influenced many languages
- FP: Functional Programming. 1977  The de facto standard for functional programming. 
- FL: Functional Level. Successor of FP

## What is it used for?	

J is extremely strong in the mathematical, statistical, and logical analysis of data. It is also extremely terse, in that everything it does is highly compact. For example, code which could take multiple lines in Java or Python, can be done in 5 characters in J.

Because it’s so terse, J is not often used in production of code. It is most often used by people for personal/internal use, but not for any situation where you would want someone to be able to read or speak it, simply because there is so much info in so few characters.

It’s great for math and science computations! (eg Project Euler)
